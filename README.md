## Drac's Pasword Manager

Welcome to my password manager. This is a simple password manager intended to be used within the terminal. I made this for personal use (and somewhat as an alternative to what my friend made), however, if you want to use this in your PC, feel free to clone it. 

# For first time users

If you are installing this for the first time, then run `first_run.py`. It'll prompt you to enter a new master password which you need to remember.

Then, you may start running `script.py` for future use. Might I suggest aliasing it to make it easier to use?

# Future

This is a personal project but is made available to public. Feel free to fork this and make your changes and then, if you want make a pull request here, and I will most probably accept it. 

Thanks for using this and I hope this is useful.
